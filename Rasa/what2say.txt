1. I have read the Rasa documentation and the Youtube playlist where they have tutorial on building Rasa assistant

2. Start with small set of intents and then use interactive learning (Using training data) to increase number of examples for each intent and further increase number of intents as well

3. But we should have predefined set of intents. and some corresponding examples.
4. Then we can increase number of examples for every intent to make our prediction more accurate
